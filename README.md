What I learned

While building this component, I practiced:

Setting up a Vite + React + Tailwind CSS project from scratch.

Centering elements using Tailwind's utility classes (flex, items-center, justify-center).

Using responsive design techniques with Tailwind.

Writing clean, minimal code for a pixel-perfect layout.

Continued development

In the future, I plan to:

Recreate more components using Tailwind to master utility-first styling.

Practice more accessibility and semantic HTML structure.

Explore animations with Tailwind and Framer Motion.

Useful resources

Tailwind CSS Documentation – Essential for learning utility classes.

React + Vite + Tailwind Setup Guide – Helped me quickly scaffold the project.
